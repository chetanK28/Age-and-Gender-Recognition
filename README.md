# Age-and-Gender-Recognition-main
**Project Title: Age-and-Gender Recognition**

**Description:**
Developed in Python, this project utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to predict the age and gender of individuals from images. It includes a trained model, dataset, and code for real-time predictions, offering a foundational framework for age and gender recognition applications.

**Components:**
1. **Dataset:** Curated images labeled with age and gender.
2. **Model:** Deep learning architecture, often CNNs.
3. **Code:** Python scripts for training and real-time inference.
4. **Metrics:** Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Usage:**
Ideal for researchers and developers interested in image-based classification tasks. The project provides a starting point for understanding and implementing age and gender recognition using Python.

**Dependencies:**
Requires popular Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and scikit-learn.
